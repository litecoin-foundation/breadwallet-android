## Litecoin done right

This is a Litecoin fork of the [breadwallet Android port](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet-android) of the [breadwallet iOS app](https://github.com/breadwallet/breadwallet/).

## A completely standalone Litecoin wallet

Unlike many other Litecoin wallets, loafwallet is a real standalone Litecoin client. There is no server to get hacked
 or go down, so you can always access your money. Using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin
 .it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, loafwallet connects directly to the Litecoin network with
 the fast performance you need on a mobile device.

## The next step in wallet security

loafwallet is designed to protect you from malware, browser security holes,
*even physical theft*. With AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and verified boot, loafwallet represents a significant security advance over
web and desktop wallets.

## Beautiful simplicity

Simplicity is loafwallet's core design principle. A simple backup phrase is all you need to restore your wallet on
another device if yours is ever lost or broken. Because loafwallet is [deterministic](https://github
.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki), your balance and transaction history can be recovered from just your backup phrase.
